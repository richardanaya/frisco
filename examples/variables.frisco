# Example: Using Variables in Frisco

# Simple variable assignments
Name = "Socrates"
Title = "philosopher"

? println(Name).
? println(Title).

# Variables can be used in multiple queries
Greeting = "Hello"

? print(Greeting).
? print(", ").
? print(Name).
? println("!").

# Variables work with concepts and entities
concept Philosopher
  description = "lover of wisdom"

entity PLATO: Philosopher
  description = "student of Socrates"

Teacher = "SOCRATES"

? println(Teacher).
